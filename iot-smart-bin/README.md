## 📖 Project Overview

The IoT Smart Bin is a full-stack waste management solution designed to optimize collection routes and monitor fill levels in real-time. This system addresses inefficiencies in traditional waste collection by providing data-driven insights to campus management.

A sensor-equipped microcontroller in each bin measures the fill level and communicates this data to a central server. The server processes and stores this data, presenting it on a web-based dashboard that displays all bins, their current status, and fill levels.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

<!-- A system architecture diagram is CRITICAL for an embedded project. -->

<!-- You can create one using tools like draw.io or lucidchart and embed it here. -->
